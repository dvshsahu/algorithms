This is the repo for algorihms and data structures based that are generally used in software development.
The programming langauage for all algorithms and data structures is c++ as it is pretty fast and contains decent set of stl library functions

The repo contains basically 2 folders at higher level, 
1. Data Structures
    - Array
    - Vector
    - Stack
    - Queue
    - Linked List
    - Ordered & Unordered Map
    - Heaps
    - Trees
    - Tries
    - Grpahs

2. Algorithms
    - Searching
    - Sorting
    - Hashing
    - Recursion
    - BackTracking
    - Greedy Algorithms
    - Dynamic Programming
    - String Algorithms


Each of the topics are having their own set of files for implementations and practice / sample problems 

The subtopics under a topic are having separate folders.
